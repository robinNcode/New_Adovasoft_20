              <h2>Energy Saving Websites</h2>
              <p>Dark colored websites saves energy because the screen is predominantly black. Image displayed is primarily a function of the user's color settings and desktop graphics, as well as the color and size of open application windows; a given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen.<br />
      <br />
      In January 2007 a blog post titled Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt-hours a Year proposed the theory that a black version of the Google search engine would save a fair bit of energy due to the popularity of the search engine. Since then there has been skepticism about the significance of the energy savings that can be achieved and the cost in terms of readability of black or dark colored web pages.<br />
      <br />
      We believe that there is value in the concept because even if the energy savings are small, they all add up. So Adova Soft encourage everyone and there clients to use dark colors for there websites. This way every time you or someone else loads your website you will save a little bit of energy. Remember every bit counts! You will also be reminded about the need to save energy each time you see your website.<br />

                      Besides energy saving the websites having dark colors are friendly to our eyes too. Staring at the bright lights of the monitors for longer period of time can cause Glaucoma and other eyesight problems. So dark colored energy saving sites not only saves energy but also saves the eye of the viewer.<br />
      <br />
      Please help us spread the word about energy saving websites by telling your friends and family. If you have a blog then give it a mention.<br />
      <br />
