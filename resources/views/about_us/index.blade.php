                        <h2>Specialties of Adova Soft</h2>
                        <p>Satisfaction of clients: In case of designing our first preference is satisfaction of our clients. We are bound to give on time delivery of quality work to achieve satisfaction of our clients.<br />
      <br />
      Speed: Many people have very slow Internet connection so if the website is not fast loading then often the viewer gets irritated and goes to another site. So we try our best to produce fast loading websites by proper HTML, CSS and PHP coding.<br />
      <br />
      Customization: Our goal is to achieve online success for our clients. So we analyze the business of our clients and prepare proper customized websites for our customers.<br />
      <br />
      Convenience: Since many of our clients are small business entrepreneurs they usually take small hosting plans. We also plan according to our clients plan to create websites which dose not require much disk space. Thus our designing style is convenient for our clients.<br />
      <br />
      Saving energy: Adova Soft are the pioneers in energy saving web designing. Dark colored websites saves energy because the screen is predominantly black. Image displayed is primarily a function of the user`s color settings and desktop graphics, as well as the color and size of open application windows; a given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen. But if our clients prefer bright and vibrant colors then we are happy to design vibrant websites, since the satisfaction of our clients is our first preference.<br />
      <br />
      Optimization: We are keen to design websites optimized for all search engines and Internet browsers to ensure online success of our clients.

               <h2>Information technology in Bangladesh</h2>
               <p>The information technology sector in Bangladesh had its beginnings in nuclear research during the 1960s. Over the next few decades, computer use increased at large Bangladeshi organizations, mostly with IBM mainframe computers. However, the sector only started to get substantial attention during the 1990s. Today the sector is still in a nascent stage, though it is showing potential for advancement.
               	<br />
               	<br />
                
                  History<br />
                  <br />
                  The first computer in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) was an IBM mainframe 1620 series, installed in 1964 at the Dhaka center of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (later the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission). Computer use increased in the following years, especially after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971; more-advanced IT equipment began to be set up in different educational, research and financial institutions.[3] In 1979, a computer centre, later renamed Department of Computer Science & Engineering, was established at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET); the centre has been playing a pivotal role in Bangladeshi IT education since its inception. Through the introduction of personal computers, the use of computers witnessed a rapid increase in the late 1980s. In 1985, succeeding several individual initiatives, the first Bengali script in computers was invented, paving the way for more intense computer activities. In 1995, use of the Internet began and locally made software started to be exported.<br />

                  <p>
                  	In 1983, the Ministry of Science and Technology established a National Computer Committee to create the required policies. The committee was also responsible to carry out programs to expand and promote the efficacious use of the sector. In 1988, the committee was replaced by the National Computer Board. In 1990, the ministry reformed the board and reconstituted it as the Bangladesh Computer Council to monitor computer- and IT-related works in the country.<br />

                  	In 2013, it was announced that a seven-year-old Bangladeshi boy, Wasik Farhan Roopkotha, would be listed as the youngest IT expert in the Guinness Book of World Records.

                  IT industry<br />
                  <br />
                  The IT industry is a relatively new sector in the country's economy. Though it is yet to make tangible contributions in the national economy, it is an important growth industry. The Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) was established in 1997 as the national trade body for software and IT service industry. Starting with only 17 member companies, by 2009 membership had grown to 326. In a study among Asian countries by Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2007–08, Bangladesh was ranked first in software and IT services competitiveness and third in competencies, after India and China.The World Bank, in a study conducted in 2008, projected triple digit growth for Bangladesh in IT services and software exports.Bangladesh was also listed as one of the top 30 Countries for Offshore Services in 2010–2011 by Gartner. The Internet penetration has also grown to 21.27 percent in 2012, up from 3.2 percent three years prior. As the Internet usage increases, the government expects the IT sector to add 7.28 percent to GDP growth by 2021.
