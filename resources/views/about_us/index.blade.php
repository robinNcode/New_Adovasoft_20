               <h2>Designing Preferences</h2>
               <p>Satisfaction of clients: In case of designing our first preference is satisfaction of our clients. We are bound to give on time delivery of quality work to achieve satisfaction of our clients.<br />
                  <br />
                  Speed: Many people have very slow Internet connection so if the website is not fast loading then often the viewer gets irritated and goes to another site. So we try our best to produce fast loading websites by proper HTML, CSS and PHP coding.<br />
                  <br />
                  Customization: Our goal is to achieve online success for our clients. So we analyze the business of our clients and prepare proper customized websites for our customers.<br />
                  <br />
                  Convenience: Since many of our clients are small business entrepreneurs they usually take small hosting plans. We also plan according to our clients plan to create websites which dose not require much disk space. Thus our designing style is convenient for our clients.<br />
                  <br />
                  Saving energy: Adova Soft are the pioneers in energy saving web designing. Dark colored websites saves energy because the screen is predominantly black. Image displayed is primarily a function of the user`s color settings and desktop graphics, as well as the color and size of open application windows; a given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen. But if our clients prefer bright and vibrant colors then we are happy to design vibrant websites, since the satisfaction of our clients is our first preference.<br />
                  <br />
                  Optimization: We are keen to design websites optimized for all search engines and Internet browsers to ensure online success of our clients.

               <h2>Information technology in Bangladesh</h2>
               <p>The information technology sector in Bangladesh had its beginnings in nuclear research during the 1960s. Over the next few decades, computer use increased at large Bangladeshi organizations, mostly with IBM mainframe computers. However, the sector only started to get substantial attention during the 1990s. Today the sector is still in a nascent stage, though it is showing potential for advancement.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  History<br />
                  <br />
                  The first computer in Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) was an IBM mainframe 1620 series, installed in 1964 at the Dhaka center of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (later the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission). Computer use increased in the following years, especially after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971; more-advanced IT equipment began to be set up in different educational, research and financial institutions.[3] In 1979, a computer centre, later renamed Department of Computer Science & Engineering, was established at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET); the centre has been playing a pivotal role in Bangladeshi IT education since its inception. Through the introduction of personal computers, the use of computers witnessed a rapid increase in the late 1980s. In 1985, succeeding several individual initiatives, the first Bengali script in computers was invented, paving the way for more intense computer activities. In 1995, use of the Internet began and locally made software started to be exported.<br />

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <div align="center">
               <b><big class='green'>Information technology in Bangladesh</big></b>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div class="vertical-row ">
         <div class="col-md-12 ">
            <br/>
            <p>
               In 1983, the Ministry of Science and Technology established a National Computer Committee to create the required policies. The committee was also responsible to carry out programs to expand and promote the efficacious use of the sector. In 1988, the committee was replaced by the National Computer Board. In 1990, the ministry reformed the board and reconstituted it as the Bangladesh Computer Council to monitor computer- and IT-related works in the country.<br />
               In 2013, it was announced that a seven-year-old Bangladeshi boy, Wasik Farhan Roopkotha, would be listed as the youngest IT expert in the Guinness Book of World Records.
               <br />
               <br />
               IT industry<br />
               <br />
               The IT industry is a relatively new sector in the country's economy. Though it is yet to make tangible contributions in the national economy, it is an important growth industry. The Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS) was established in 1997 as the national trade body for software and IT service industry. Starting with only 17 member companies, by 2009 membership had grown to 326. In a study among Asian countries by Japan International Cooperation Agency in 2007–08, Bangladesh was ranked first in software and IT services competitiveness and third in competencies, after India and China.The World Bank, in a study conducted in 2008, projected triple digit growth for Bangladesh in IT services and software exports.Bangladesh was also listed as one of the top 30 Countries for Offshore Services in 2010–2011 by Gartner. The Internet penetration has also grown to 21.27 percent in 2012, up from 3.2 percent three years prior. As the Internet usage increases, the government expects the IT sector to add 7.28 percent to GDP growth by 2021.

               <h2>Database Solution in Bangladesh</h2>
               <p>Bangladesh is a diverse country having a large population resulting huge number of organization such as industries, school, collage, universities, clinics, hospitals, IT companies and so on. In each of these organizations have the necessity to deal with data of numerous people involved in them. This large amount of data is very hard to manage and manipulate. In most institutions and organizations in Bangladesh thus data is stored in computers using conventional file system is difficult to maintain and organize. Besides its data access can not be controlled. Whoever gets access to the computer instantly gets access to the data stored in file system. Only a few IT companies and telecommunication companies are storing data in databases. <br />
                  <br />
                  One of the main reasons for the lack of usage of databases is that, people are not aware of the benefits of database. Database store data in a very organized way as a result data can be accessed, manipulated and traversed easily. But most people are unaware of these benefits of databases as a result they rely on conventional file systems. <br />
                  <br />

            <br/>
            <p>
               Another reason of not using databases in institutions and organizations is financial.

               <h2>Energy Saving Websites</h2>
               <p>Dark colored websites saves energy because the screen is predominantly black. Image displayed is primarily a function of the user's color settings and desktop graphics, as well as the color and size of open application windows; a given monitor requires more power to display a white (or light) screen than a black (or dark) screen.<br />
                  <br />
                  In January 2007 a blog post titled Black Google Would Save 750 Megawatt-hours a Year proposed the theory that a black version of the Google search engine would save a fair bit of energy due to the popularity of the search engine. Since then there has been skepticism about the significance of the energy savings that can be achieved and the cost in terms of readability of black or dark colored web pages.<br />
                  <br />
                  We believe that there is value in the concept because even if the energy savings are small, they all add up. So Adova Soft encourage everyone and there clients to use dark colors for there websites. This way every time you or someone else loads your website you will save a little bit of energy. Remember every bit counts! You will also be reminded about the need to save energy each time you see your website.<br />
                  <br />
               </p>

         </div>
         <div class="col-md-6 singlebigimg" align="center">
            <a href='http://www.blackle.com/' target='_blank'><img src='images/db/505.png' alt='www.blackle.com'/></a>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <div align="center">
               <b><big class='green'>www.blackle.com</big></b>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
      <div class="vertical-row ">
         <div class="col-md-12 ">
            <br/>
            <p>
               Besides energy saving the websites having dark colors are friendly to our eyes too. Staring at the bright lights of the monitors for longer period of time can cause Glaucoma and other eyesight problems. So dark colored energy saving sites not only saves energy but also saves the eye of the viewer.<br />
               <br />
               Please help us spread the word about energy saving websites by telling your friends and family. If you have a blog then give it a mention.<br />
               <br />
               The worlds top Search engine Google has an energy saving version called Blackle (http://www.blackle.com/). We encourage everyone to set Blackle as home page. In this way every time you load your Internet browser you will save a little bit of energy. Remember every bit counts! You will also be reminded about the need to save energy each time you see the Blackle page load.<br />
               <br />
               Let us save energy to save the world. The Adova Soft team is willing to promote the concept of energy saving websites for the betterment of the world. Please be a comrade of our cause and chose us to design an energy saving site for you.<br />
